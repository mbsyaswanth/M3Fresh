This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Introduction to this application

We designed this project for online delivery of daily-essentials in my town. This application was born due to the covid-19 situation and lack of local online delivery platforms. Through this project, we were able to provide a simple and robust solution for onine order system that helps customers and the people who were providing the service. We presented this application for use by our district. 
Initially they started tele-booking service and later extended to online through this app. What all they needed was a simple platform where they can upload their products and update them and customers will just order the products using their address.

## Technical details 
Backend - firebase

For managing products - We gave them a google sheet where they can add/update their products directly to the databse on click on a button within google sheet.

For managing orders - a open route with /orders where they can view all the orders

Frontend - React.js with hooks (no 3rd party library for state management)
